# RL_audio
Codebase for audio communication reinforcement learning (RL) bandit algorithm. This repository enables a virtual robot to learn to communicate different functional robot states using parameterized audio.

## Main Files

This method was deployed and tested in a user study. This study took the form of a Jupyter notebook. We have provided detailed markdown comments within the Notebook to equip reviewers with a step-by-step detailed description of the study protocol for reproduction. This notebook is found here:

https://github.com/liamreneroy/RL_audio/blob/main/notebooks/study_notebook.ipynb

All the statistical analyses for our three hypotheses (H1, H2, H3) are here:
