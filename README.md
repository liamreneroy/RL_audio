# RL_audio
Codebase for audio communication reinforcement learning (RL) bandit algorithm. This repository enables a virtual robot to learn to communicate different functional robot states using parameterized audio.

## Main Files
This method was deployed and tested in a user study. This study took the form of a Jupyter notebook. We provide the original interactive survey (Jupyter Notebook) with added step-by-step markdown comments describing the study procedure to enable reproducibility. 

### The Jupyter notebook used for our study is here:
https://github.com/liamreneroy/RL_audio/blob/main/notebooks/study_notebook.ipynb

### The sound libraries used for each robot are here:

### The arrays and images for Informed Initializations are here:
https://github.com/liamreneroy/RL_audio/tree/main/notebooks/arrays

### The statistical analyses for our three hypotheses (H1, H2, H3) are here:
